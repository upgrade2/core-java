1. Basics of Java
   - Introduction to Java: History, features, and evolution of Java.
   - Java Development Environment: Installing JDK, setting up IDEs (like Eclipse, IntelliJ), and understanding the Java runtime environment.
   - Hello World Program: Writing and executing your first Java program.

2. Data Types and Variables
   - Primitive Data Types: int, float, double, char, boolean, byte, short, long.
   - Non-Primitive Data Types: Classes, arrays, strings.
   - Variable Declaration and Initialization.

3. Operators and Expressions
   - Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %.
   - Relational Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=.
   - Logical Operators: &&, ||, !.
   - Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>.
   - Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=.

4. Control Flow Statements
   - Decision Making: if, if-else, else-if, switch.
   - Loops: for, while, do-while.
   - Branching: break, continue, return.

5. Classes and Objects
   - Class Declaration: Fields, methods, and constructors.
   - Object Creation: Using the new keyword.
   - Method Overloading.
   - Constructor Overloading.

6. Inheritance
   - Inheritance Basics: extends keyword.
   - Method Overriding.
   - super Keyword: Accessing parent class methods and constructors.
   - Types of Inheritance: Single, multilevel, hierarchical (Java does not support multiple inheritance through classes, but it can be achieved using interfaces).

7. Polymorphism
   - Compile-time Polymorphism: Method overloading.
   - Runtime Polymorphism: Method overriding.

8. Abstraction
   - Abstract Classes: abstract keyword, abstract methods.
   - Interfaces: interface keyword, implementing interfaces, default and static methods in interfaces.

9. Encapsulation
   - Private Fields: Getter and setter methods.
   - Access Modifiers: private, protected, public, default.

10. Packages and Access Modifiers
    - Creating Packages: package keyword.
    - Importing Packages: import keyword.
    - Access Levels: Understanding the scope and visibility of classes, methods, and fields.

11. Exception Handling
    - Try-Catch Blocks: Handling exceptions using try, catch, and finally.
    - Types of Exceptions: Checked and unchecked exceptions.
    - Throwing Exceptions: throw and throws keywords.
    - Custom Exceptions: Creating your own exception classes.

12. String Handling
    - String Class: Creating and manipulating strings.
    - StringBuffer and StringBuilder: For mutable strings.
    - Common String Methods: length(), charAt(), substring(), indexOf(), toLowerCase(), toUpperCase(), etc.

13. Collections Framework
    - Collection Interfaces: List, Set, Map.
    - Collection Classes: ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, TreeMap.
    - Iterators: Iterator and ListIterator.

14. Multithreading and Concurrency
    - Thread Class: Creating and starting threads.
    - Runnable Interface: Implementing threads.
    - Thread Lifecycle.
    - Synchronization: Handling concurrency issues.
    - Executor Framework: Managing thread pools.

15. I/O Streams
    - Byte Streams: FileInputStream, FileOutputStream.
    - Character Streams: FileReader, FileWriter.
    - Buffered Streams: BufferedReader, BufferedWriter.
    - Serialization: Converting objects to byte streams.

16. Networking
    - Networking Basics: Sockets, ports, and IP addresses.
    - Java Networking API: Socket, ServerSocket, InetAddress, URL.

17. Java 8 Features
    - Lambda Expressions.
    - Functional Interfaces.
    - Stream API.
    - Default and Static Methods in Interfaces.

18. Java 9 and Beyond
    - Module System.
    - Enhanced try-with-resources.
    - Local-Variable Type Inference (Java 10).
    - Enhanced Switch Expressions (Java 12).
