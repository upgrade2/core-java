2. Data Types and Variables
   - Primitive Data Types: int, float, double, char, boolean, byte, short, long.
   - Non-Primitive Data Types: Classes, arrays, strings.
   - Variable Declaration and Initialization.

3. Operators and Expressions
   - Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %.
   - Relational Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=.
   - Logical Operators: &&, ||, !.
   - Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=.

4. Control Flow Statements
   - Decision Making: if, if-else, else-if, switch.
   - Loops: for, while, do-while.
   - Branching: break, continue, return.

5. Classes and Objects
   - Class Declaration: Fields, methods, and constructors.

   - super Keyword: Accessing parent class methods and constructors.

7. Polymorphism
   - Compile-time Polymorphism: Method overloading.
   - Runtime Polymorphism: Method overriding.

8. Abstraction
   - Abstract Classes: abstract keyword, abstract methods.
   - Interfaces: interface keyword, implementing interfaces, default and static methods in interfaces.

9. Encapsulation
   - Private Fields: Getter and setter methods.
   - Access Modifiers: private, protected, public, default.

11. Exception Handling
    - Try-Catch Blocks: Handling exceptions using try, catch, and finally.
